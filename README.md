# ðŸŽµ Sneaky S0ng ðŸŽµ
___
Sneaky S0ng is a music cipher that generates a complex song for you, with a secret message hidden inside. Using MuseScore, as we did, or other music-making applications, Sneaky $0ng can generate sheet music, complete with notations and dynamics. 
Although we can't promise that your cipher will sound good when played, it will be tough to decipher. This is due in part to the complex series of beats utilizing different pitches to create a cipher that is almost impossible for most people to crack.
