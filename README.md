___
$neaky $0ng is a music cipher that generates a complex song for you, with a secret message hidden inside. Using MuseScore, as we did, or other music-making applications, Sneaky $0ng can generate sheet music, complete with notations and dynamics. 
Although we can't promise that your cipher will sound good when played, it will be tough to decipher. This is due in part to the complex series of beats utilizing different pitches to create a cipher that is almost impossible for most people to crack.

### USING IT. 

Once you have finished installing the repository, you will want to open the file called music.py. To run the program type `python3 music.py`, followed by the sentence that you want to be ciphered inside a pair of parentheses. You will then be asked the question *"Do you have a musicxml reader? Y or N:"* and you need to respond with a `y` or an `n` respectively. **You will need to answer this truthfully to proceed!**
